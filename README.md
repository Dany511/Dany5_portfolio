# [Project 1: California Housing Price Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dany511/P1_Housing_Price_Pred)
• In this project, I have created a Machine Learning model which predicts the housing prices of california.This is a project from my PG-AI Data science with Python course.


• Performed Data Preprocessing which includes Importing all the crucial libraries,Importing the dataset, Missing values imputation, Encoding the categorical data.


• Performed Data Splitting 80% of the total data as Training Dataset and 20% of the total data as Testing dataset.Performed Data Standardization using StandardScaler


• Performed Model Training and Model Testing using LinearRegression,I was able to get this model to achieve a MSE value of 69710.1 which is good because the values of housing       prices are way large than the MSE.

# [Project 2: Classifiction Of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dany511/machinelearning_projects)
• Created a Machine Learning model that predicts the cancer whether it is malignant or benign to help doctors to proceed for further diagnosis.
  
  
• Collected data from kaggle website.Performed Data Preprocessing which includes Importing all the crucial libraries,Importing the dataset, Missing values imputation, Encoding     the categorical data.
  
  
• Performed Data Splitting 80% of the total data as Training Dataset and 20% of the total data as Testing dataset.Performed Data Standardization using StandardScaler.
  
  
• Performed Model Training and Model Testing using various Classification algorithms.As here we are dealing with the clinical data the risk of predicting a cancer as benign       when it is actually malignant costs a life.
  
  
  The recall is the measure of our model correctly identifying True Positives. Thus, for all the patients who actually have Malignant cancer, recall tells us how many we correctly   identified as having a Malignant cancer
