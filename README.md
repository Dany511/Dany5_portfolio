# [Project 2: Classifiction Of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dany511/machinelearning_projects)
  Created a Machine Learning model that predicts the cancer whether it is malignant or benign to help doctors to proceed for further diagnosis.
  Collected data from kaggle website.Performed Data Preprocessing which includes Importing all the crucial libraries,Importing the dataset, Missing values imputation, Encoding the   categorical data.
  Performed Data Splitting 80% of the total data as Training Dataset and 20% of the total data as Testing dataset.Performed Data Standardization using StandardScaler
  Performed Model Training,Model Evaluation and Testing using various Classification algorithms.As here we are dealing with the clinical data the risk of predicting a cancer as     benign when it is actually malignant costs a life.
  The recall is the measure of our model correctly identifying True Positives. Thus, for all the patients who actually have Malignant cancer, recall tells us how many we correctly   identified as having a Malignant cancer
  For this project, the best Recall score we can get is Recall  = 0.86. Recall also gives a measure of how accurately our model is able to identify the relevant data. We refer to   it as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate. What if a patient has Malignant cancer, but there is no treatment given to him/her because our model predicted so? That is a situation     we would like to avoid!
