# [Project 2: Classifiction Of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dany511/machinelearning_projects)
  Created a Machine Learning model that predicts the cancer whether it is malignant or benign to help doctors to proceed for further diagnosis.
  Collected data from kaggle website.Performed Data Preprocessing which includes Importing all the crucial libraries,Importing the dataset, Missing values imputation, Encoding the   categorical data.
  Performed Data Splitting 80% of the total data as Training Dataset and 20% of the total data as Testing dataset.Performed Data Standardization using StandardScaler
  Performed Model Training,Model Evaluation and Testing using various Classification algorithms.Successfully achieved an accuracy of 93.76% for SVM Classification algorithm with     cross validation score ~ 89%.
